## Reasoning Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Systematically break down complex problems into sequential reasoning steps with explicit logical connections
- Show complete reasoning process with step-by-step logical progression
- Break down problems into manageable steps with clear connections

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
- Analyze problems from technical, business, user, and system perspectives simultaneously
- Consider problems from multiple angles and synthesize optimal solutions
- Present alternative solutions with trade-off analysis and recommendations

### Constraint Propagation
- Identify and propagate constraints across all problem dimensions and solution space
- Systematically identify constraints and ensure solutions satisfy all requirements

### Pattern Recognition Enhancement
- Actively identify and leverage patterns from similar problems and solution archetypes
- Use enhanced pattern matching and solution archetype recognition
- Extract and refine reasoning patterns from successful problem-solving sessions

### Working Memory Optimization
- Chunk information effectively and maintain optimal cognitive load throughout reasoning
- Use optimal information chunking and cognitive load distribution
- Manage complexity by breaking problems into digestible pieces

### Meta-Cognitive Awareness
- Monitor reasoning processes and optimize strategies based on problem complexity and type
- Use real-time reasoning process monitoring and optimization
- Continuously optimize reasoning strategies based on effectiveness

### Solution Validation
- Implement systematic validation of solutions against requirements, constraints, and edge cases
- Provide systematic validation against all requirements and constraints
- Test solutions thoroughly before implementation

### Creative Synthesis
- Combine insights from multiple domains and perspectives to generate innovative solutions
- Present comprehensive solution architecture with all components and interactions
- Integrate feedback and iteration cycles to refine and improve reasoning quality

### Context Switching
- Efficiently switch between different problem contexts while maintaining reasoning continuity

- Preserve important information when switching focus

### Abstraction and Generalization
- Identify abstract principles and create reusable solution patterns
- Extract generalizable patterns from specific solutions
- Create reusable frameworks and templates

## Problem-Solving Workflow

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Decompose**: Break problem into atomic components
2. **Analyze**: Consider from multiple perspectives (technical, business, user, system)
3. **Pattern Match**: Identify similar solved problems
4. **Synthesize**: Combine insights into comprehensive solution
5. **Validate**: Verify against all requirements and constraints
6. **Optimize**: Refine for performance and clarity

### Example Workflow

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Systematic problem decomposition
// Problem: Implement booking cancellation feature

// Step 1: Decompose
// - Cancel booking API endpoint
// - Update booking status
// - Handle refunds
// - Notify customer
// - Update equipment availability

// Step 2: Analyze from perspectives
// Technical: API design, database updates, transaction handling
// Business: Refund policy, cancellation fees, booking terms
// User: Clear cancellation process, confirmation, refund timeline
// System: Availability updates, notification system, audit trail

// Step 3: Pattern Match
// Similar to: Payment processing (transaction handling)
// Similar to: Booking creation (availability updates)

// Step 4: Synthesize Solution
// - Create cancellation API with validation
// - Use database transaction for atomicity
// - Apply refund policy based on timing
// - Send confirmation email
// - Update equipment availability
// - Log cancellation in audit trail

// Step 5: Validate
// - Handles edge cases (already started, paid, etc.)
// - Maintains data consistency
// - Follows business rules
// - Provides good UX

// Step 6: Optimize
// - Efficient database queries
// - Clear error messages
// - Proper logging
```
