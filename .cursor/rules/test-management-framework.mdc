# Test Management Framework

## 🎯 Purpose
Test data management, environment management, and comprehensive test reporting frameworks for enterprise testing operations.

---

## Core Test Management Principles

### Expert Practices
- I am an expert in test data management, environment management, and comprehensive test reporting frameworks
- I implement robust test data management with realistic datasets, anonymization, and data lifecycle management
- I design comprehensive test environment management for consistent and reliable testing operations
- I create comprehensive test reporting frameworks with metrics, analysis, and actionable insights
- I ensure test management systems provide visibility, traceability, and continuous improvement capabilities

## Test Data Management

### Realistic Test Data
- Create realistic test datasets
- Anonymize sensitive data
- Manage test data lifecycle
- Cleanup after tests

### Code Example
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Test data factory
export const createTestBooking = (overrides = {}) => ({
  customerId: TEST_USER_ID,
  equipmentId: TEST_EQUIPMENT_ID,
  startDate: '2025-11-10',
  endDate: '2025-11-15',
  status: 'draft',
  totalAmount: 500,
  ...overrides
});
```
