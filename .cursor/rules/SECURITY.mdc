# Security & Compliance

## 🎯 Purpose
Comprehensive security protocols, threat protection, and compliance standards for the Kubota Rental Platform.

---

## Security-First Development

### Core Security Principles
1. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
4. **Input Validation**: Never trust user input
5. **Secure by Default**: Security built-in, not bolted-on

---

## Specialized Security Rules

For detailed security standards, see:
- **Security Standards**: `security-standards.mdc` - Input validation, authentication, authorization, API security
- **Security Compliance**: `security-compliance.mdc` - Snyk integration, compliance, incident response, payment security

## Snyk Security Integration

### Mandatory Snyk Scanning

**ALWAYS run Snyk scans for new code:**

1. **Run scan** for new first-party code in Snyk-supported languages
   ```typescript
   // ✅ ALWAYS scan new code
   // Use snyk_code_scan tool for generated code
   ```

2. **Fix issues** using Snyk results context
   - Review Snyk findings
   - Fix security vulnerabilities
   - Address dependency issues

3. **Rescan** after fixes
   - Verify issues are resolved
   - Ensure no new issues introduced

4. **Repeat** until no issues found
   - Continue scanning and fixing
   - Don't proceed until clean scan

**Process:**
- Scan → Fix → Rescan → Repeat until clean
