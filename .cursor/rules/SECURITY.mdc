# Security & Compliance

## 🎯 Purpose
Comprehensive security protocols, threat protection, and compliance standards for the Kubota Rental Platform.

---

## Security-First Development

### Core Security Principles
1. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
4. **Input Validation**: Never trust user input
5. **Secure by Default**: Security built-in, not bolted-on

---

## Specialized Security Rules

For detailed security standards, see:
- **Security Standards**: `security-standards.mdc` - Input validation, authentication, authorization, API security
- **Security Compliance**: `security-compliance.mdc` - Security review, compliance, incident response, payment security

## Security Review Process

### Mandatory Security Review

**ALWAYS review code for security issues:**

1. **Review code** for new first-party code
   ```typescript
   // ✅ ALWAYS review new code for security
   // Check for common vulnerabilities
   // Verify input validation
   // Test authentication/authorization
   ```

2. **Fix issues** found during review
   - Review security findings
   - Fix security vulnerabilities
   - Address dependency issues

3. **Verify fixes** after changes
   - Test security fixes
   - Ensure no new issues introduced

4. **Repeat** until no issues found
   - Continue reviewing and fixing
   - Don't proceed until security review complete

**Process:**
- Review → Fix → Verify → Repeat until clean
