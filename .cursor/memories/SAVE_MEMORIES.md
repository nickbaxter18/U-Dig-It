# How to Actually Save Cursor Memories

**Problem**: Cursor's memory system shows "No Memories Yet" because memories need to be saved through Cursor's UI, not just by saying "Remember:" in chat.

## ✅ Correct Way to Save Memories

### Option 1: Through Cursor Settings UI (Recommended)
1. Open Cursor Settings (right sidebar)
2. Scroll to "Saved Memories" section
3. Click "Add Memory" or the "+" button
4. Paste each memory text
5. Save

### Option 2: Through Cursor Chat with Explicit Request
1. In Cursor chat, say: **"Please save this as a memory: [memory text]"**
2. Cursor will prompt you to confirm
3. Click "Save" when prompted

- As you use patterns, Cursor will learn them
