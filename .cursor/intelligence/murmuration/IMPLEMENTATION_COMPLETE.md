When one rule activates, it signals its neighbors, creating exponential information spread across the network.

### **3. Emergent Pattern Recognition**
The system identifies patterns that emerge from rule combinations, generating insights beyond individual rule capabilities.

### **4. Distributed Reasoning Threads**
Multiple reasoning threads operate like individual starlings, coordinating through shared knowledge graphs.

### **5. Background Optimization**
Autonomous agents continuously optimize the network, evolve patterns, and monitor health.
